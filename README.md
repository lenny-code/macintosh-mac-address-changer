# MAC address changer for macintoshA script to change the MAC address (media access control address) of your Macintosh computer.## How to use itAt first you need to adjust the few variables in the configuration area at the top of the script. Change the interface variables to your wireless and ethernet interfaces. To find the corresponding MAC addresses, consult```networksetup -listallhardwareports```in a terminal.After you're done with the configuration setup, switch into the folder where this script is located and run```chmod +x mac-address-changer.sh```Now you can can change your MAC addresses to random ones by running```./mac-address-changer.sh random```and back to their original ones (saved in the variables in the configuration area at the begin of the script) by running```./mac-address-changer.sh home```Done!## What you might want to doYou could put this script with the 'random' behaviour into some kind of start up routine. This will change your MAC addresses to random ones each time you start up your Mac.Enjoy!
